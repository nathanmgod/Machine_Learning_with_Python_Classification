# Classification in Machine Learning with Python
In this project, I applied some of the most used Classification Models such as Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression in order to make predictions if a customer was more likely to pay the loan or not. After building the models, I used the Jaccard Score, F1 Score and Log Loss for Model Evaluation, which tells about the accuracy of the Classification Models.
